          Hi! My name is Danielle Berger. I was born in New York but I was raised in
          New Jersey. I'm passionate about photography, fashion, and visual studies,
          and I am currently a sophomore communication design student at Parsons. I
          also work as a sales associate at Madewell and as a graphic designer at
          Lang.
        </p>

            I don't quite have a favorite Wikipedia page, but after every show or
            movie I watch, I love looking up the Wikipedia pages about the actors
            and actresses that were involved!
